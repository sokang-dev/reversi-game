/**
 * These two functions initialise the player structure at the beginning of the
 * game. In both cases, you should initialise the whole structure to known safe
 * values and then prompt the user for their name. In the initFirstPlayer()
 * function you should then select a color at random for this player using the
 * rand() function. This token should be assigned to the first player's token.
 * In initSecondPlayer() you should just test the value of token and assign the
 * opposite color to the second player.
 * 
 * Note that an empty name is not valid and the user should be re-prompted.
